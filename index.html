    Make questions multiple choice (like a, b, or c) and determine which track is right for a user by identifying the letter that was most frequently selected. For example: "You chose mostly a's, you should definitely study C#!".
    Use fade in/out or slide in/out jQuery Effects throughout your project.
    Other enhancements such as more custom CSS, animation, or modals as you desire.

      <p>Congratulations! You are an ideal candidate for learning <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python!</a> Python is a fun little language, lacking a lot of the characteristics of most well-known programming languages, such as ending lines with semicolons and declaring variables with their type right at the get-go. Indentation is important, but you won't see very much punctuation from a beginning program. Additionally, it reads very well to the human eye, making reading over someone else's code a breeze.</p>

      <p>Here are some resources to learning Python:

      <p>Congratulations! You are an ideal candidate for learning <a href="https://www.cplusplus.com/">C++!</a> C++ is an extension of the C programming language. It was designed for system programming, and can be found in video game programming, web servers, and sometimes space probes. C++ can be quite powerful, but can also feel confusing to new users. The first time you see "std::cout << a;" might throw you for a loop, but it very quickly becomes familiar.</p>

JavaScript, not to be confused with Java, is one of the core backbones of our current internet. Almost everything that a website can functionally do, regarding things higher level than just displaying text, is probably made in JavaScript. You should visit your favorite site without JavaScript on and see what breaks! Remember to fix it when you're done...</p>
