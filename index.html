    Make questions multiple choice (like a, b, or c) and determine which track is right for a user by identifying the letter that was most frequently selected. For example: "You chose mostly a's, you should definitely study C#!".
    Use fade in/out or slide in/out jQuery Effects throughout your project.
    Other enhancements such as more custom CSS, animation, or modals as you desire.
